## Introduction
Our group is named Group 70, which is in reference to the UNIX epoch. The members of this group are Weiyu Feng, Jingsong Tan, and Joseph Vitale. For our project, we created a movie review site using Angular, a movie database API, and Firebase. Jingson was the most comfortable with backend, so he worked on the Firbase and API code. Weiyu and Joseph split the front-end work. Weiyu worked on the login and movie details page. Joseph worked on the home and preview page. 

## Problem
We want to create a website that allows people to search for a movie, view movie information, and leave a review.
